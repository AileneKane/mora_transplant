1) 2013 TransplantStatusHeight(October).csv
Four-month old seedlings were transplanted in October 2010, at experimental sites at seven elevations on Mt. Rainier. Strong climatic gradients exist on Mt. Rainier: temperatures decline and precipitation increases with rising elevation.
Seedlings were transplanted into plots in five blocked replicates per elevation (20 plots per elevation, 4 plots per block). All transplant sites occurred in closed canopy forests, except the highest elevation site, which was located in subalpine parkland, where “canopy gaps” are often small meadows. We planted 15 (forABAM and TSME) or 16 (for TSHE) total seedlings per species per plot: five seedlings per origin for ABAM and TSHE, and eight seedlings per origin forTSHE. Seedlings were grown at University of Washington for four months, then transplanted into plots on Mt. Rainier in October 2010, and watered at the time of transplant only.

3) TransplantLocations.csvColumn descriptions
Name: Waypoints are names by the permanent stand adjacent to which they are located. They are desgnated with "G" for "Gap" and "N" for "Nongap" to designate the canopy status of the plots. They were then assigned a number from 1 to 5. Each permanent stand has 5 gaps located around it and these gaps are paired with 5 nongaps, located within 10-20 meters of the gap. In some cases, separate waypoints were not taken for nongaps (e.g. at PARA), because they are always adjacent to their paired gap.
DateTime: date-month-year and time of day that waypoint was collected.
Latitude: units=hddd.ddddd°, datum=WGS84
Longitude: units=hddd.ddddd°, datum=WGS84
Altitude: units=meters, measured from the GPS
